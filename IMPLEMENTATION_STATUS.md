# Implementation Status

## Summary

The subdivision solver has been redesigned with a **method-agnostic architecture** that supports multiple bounding methods (PP, LP, Hybrid) with minimal code duplication.

**Key Achievement**: The solver is now ready for LP and Hybrid method implementations. All the infrastructure is in place - only the bounding box computation functions need to be implemented.

## Completed Work

### ✅ Solver Redesign
- **File**: `src/intersection/subdivision_solver.py`
- **Status**: Complete and tested
- **Changes**:
  - Completely redesigned to match `visualize_2d_step_by_step.py` logic
  - Fixed fundamental architectural flaw (re-computing PP on extracted coefficients)
  - Performance improvement: 1500x faster on 2D problems (13 boxes vs 20,000+)
  - Recursive solving with proper bound preservation

### ✅ Method Abstraction
- **File**: `src/intersection/subdivision_solver.py`
- **Status**: Complete
- **Features**:
  - `BoundingMethod` enum for PP/LP/Hybrid selection
  - `_find_bounding_box()` dispatcher method
  - Separate methods for each bounding approach:
    - `_find_bounding_box_pp()` - Implemented ✅
    - `_find_bounding_box_lp()` - Stub (falls back to PP) ⏳
    - `_find_bounding_box_hybrid()` - Stub (falls back to PP) ⏳

### ✅ PP Method Implementation
- **File**: `src/intersection/convex_hull.py`
- **Function**: `find_root_box_pp_nd()`

## Pending Work

### ⏳ LP Method Implementation
- **File**: `src/intersection/subdivision_solver.py`
- **Function**: `_find_bounding_box_lp()`
- **Status**: Stub implementation (currently falls back to PP)
- **TODO**:
  1. Formulate bounding box problem as linear program
  2. For each dimension j, solve two LPs:
     - Minimize t_j subject to: all control points ≥ 0
     - Maximize t_j subject to: all control points ≥ 0
  3. Integrate scipy.optimize.linprog or other LP solver
  4. Handle edge cases (unbounded, infeasible)
  5. Optimize for performance (caching, warm starts)

**Expected Benefits**:
- Tighter bounds than PP method
- Fewer boxes processed
- Better for hard problems

**Expected Drawbacks**:
- Slower per-box (LP solving overhead)
- Requires external LP solver

### ⏳ Hybrid Method Implementation
- **File**: `src/intersection/subdivision_solver.py`
- **Function**: `_find_bounding_box_hybrid()`
- **Status**: Stub implementation (currently falls back to PP)
- **TODO**:
  1. Implement PP-first strategy
  2. Add threshold parameter for when to use LP
  3. If PP bounds are tight enough (width < threshold), use PP
  4. Otherwise, refine with LP method
  5. Tune threshold based on problem characteristics
  6. Add adaptive threshold adjustment

**Expected Benefits**:
- Balances speed and accuracy
- Fast for easy problems (uses PP)
- Accurate for hard problems (uses LP)

**Expected Drawbacks**:
- More complex logic
- Requires tuning threshold parameter

## Architecture Overview

### Method-Agnostic Design

The solver is designed so that **PP, LP, and Hybrid methods differ ONLY in how they compute bounding boxes**. All other logic is identical:

```python
def _solve_recursive(self, coeffs_list, box_range, depth):
    # Step 1: Apply bounding method (ONLY DIFFERENCE)
    bounding_result = self._find_bounding_box(coeffs_list)
    
    # Steps 2-4: IDENTICAL FOR ALL METHODS
    # - Check if small enough (solution)
    # - Check depth limit
    # - Check CRIT (tighten or subdivide)
    # - Extract sub-boxes and recurse
```

### Adding a New Method

To implement LP or Hybrid (or any new method):

1. **Implement the bounding function**:
   ```python
   def _find_bounding_box_lp(self, coeffs_list):
       # Your LP implementation here
       # Must return List[Tuple[float, float]] or None
       pass
   ```

2. **That's it!** The rest of the solver automatically works with the new method.

No changes needed to:
- Subdivision logic
- Tightening logic
- Recursion logic
- Solution detection
- Statistics tracking
- Benchmarking

## Testing

### Current Test Results

All tests pass with PP method:

```
1D Quadratic:
  - Boxes processed: 7
  - Time: 0.002 seconds
  - Solutions: 2 (correct)

2D Circle-Ellipse:
  - Boxes processed: 13
  - Time: 0.007 seconds
  - Solutions: 1 (correct)
  - Solution: (0.894427, 0.447214)
  - Residuals: < 1e-8
```

### Method Comparison Test

`examples/test_methods.py` demonstrates that all three methods currently produce identical results (since LP and Hybrid fall back to PP):

```
Method     Boxes      Pruned     Subdivisions
------------------------------------------------
PP         13         1          1
LP         13         1          1
Hybrid     13         1          1
```

Once LP and Hybrid are implemented, we expect:
- LP: Fewer boxes, slower per-box
- Hybrid: Balanced performance

## Performance Comparison (Expected)

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Boxes | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| PP     | Fast  | Good     | Baseline | Default choice |
| LP     | Slow  | Excellent| Fewer | Maximum accuracy |
| Hybrid | Medium| Excellent| Fewer | Balanced |
