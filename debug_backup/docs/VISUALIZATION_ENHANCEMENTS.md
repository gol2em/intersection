# 3D Visualization Enhancements - Control Point Projections

## Overview

Enhanced the 3D visualizations to show **control point projections and convex hulls on background walls**, making it easy to understand how the PP (Projected Polyhedron) method works.

## What's New

### Projections on Background Walls

For each equation, the visualization now shows:

1. **Back Wall (y = y_max)**: Projection onto (x, f) plane
   - **Black dots**: Projected control points
   - **Dashed lines**: Convex hull of projected points
   - **Thick solid line at f=0**: PP bounds for x-dimension

2. **Side Wall (x = x_min)**: Projection onto (y, f) plane
   - **Black dots**: Projected control points
   - **Dashed lines**: Convex hull of projected points
   - **Thick solid line at f=0**: PP bounds for y-dimension

### Visual Elements

**Color Coding**:
- Blue: Equation 1 (circle: x² + y² - 1 = 0)
- Red: Equation 2 (ellipse: x²/4 + 4y² - 1 = 0)
- Green: z=0 plane and PP bounds box
- Black: Control points in 3D space
- Gold star: Expected solution

**On Each Wall**:
- Control points are projected and shown as colored dots
- Convex hull edges shown as dashed lines
- Intersection with f=0 axis shown as thick solid line (the PP bounds!)

## How the PP Method Works (Visualized)

### Step 1: Project Control Points

For dimension j (e.g., x-dimension):
1. Take all control points (i/n, j/m, f_ij) in 3D
2. Project onto 2D plane (i/n, f_ij)
3. This projection is shown on the back wall

### Step 2: Compute Convex Hull

1. Compute 2D convex hull of projected points
2. Shown as dashed lines on the wall

### Step 3: Find Intersection with f=0

1. Find where convex hull crosses the f=0 axis
2. This gives the PP bounds for that dimension
3. Shown as thick solid line on the wall at f=0

### Step 4: Repeat for All Dimensions

- X-dimension: Shown on back wall (y = y_max)
- Y-dimension: Shown on side wall (x = x_min)

## Files Modified

### `examples/visualize_2d_step_by_step.py`

**Added function**: `draw_projections_on_walls()`
- Projects control points onto (x, f) and (y, f) planes
- Computes 2D convex hulls
- Draws projections on background walls
- Marks PP bounds as thick lines at f=0

**Modified functions**:
- `plot_surface()`: Now calls `draw_projections_on_walls()` for each equation
- `plot_both_surfaces()`: Shows projections for both equations on the combined view

## New Demonstration Script

### `examples/demo_projection_walls.py`

A focused demonstration showing:
- One equation at a time
- Clear view of projections on walls
- Detailed explanation of what each element means

**Generated files**:
- `projection_demo_circle.png`: Circle equation with projections
- `projection_demo_ellipse.png`: Ellipse equation with projections

## Example Output

### Circle: x² + y² - 1 = 0

**Back Wall (x-projection)**:
- Control points at (0, -1), (0.5, -1), (1, 0), etc.
- Convex hull forms a polygon
- Intersection with f=0: **x ∈ [0, 1]**

**Side Wall (y-projection)**:
- Control points at (0, -1), (0.5, -1), (1, 0), etc.
- Convex hull forms a polygon
- Intersection with f=0: **y ∈ [0, 1]**

### Ellipse: x²/4 + 4y² - 1 = 0

**Back Wall (x-projection)**:
- Control points with different values
- Convex hull forms a polygon
- Intersection with f=0: **x ∈ [0, 1]**

**Side Wall (y-projection)**:
- Control points with different values
- Convex hull forms a polygon
- Intersection with f=0: **y ∈ [0.1875, 0.625]** ← Tighter!

## Understanding the Visualization

### What You See

1. **3D Surface**: The actual polynomial surface f(x, y)
2. **Green Plane**: The z=0 plane where we're looking for roots
3. **Colored Curve**: Where the surface intersects z=0 (the solution curve)
4. **Black Dots in 3D**: Bernstein control points
5. **Projections on Walls**: 
   - Colored dots: Projected control points
   - Dashed lines: Convex hull
   - Thick solid line: PP bounds

### Why This Matters

The visualization clearly shows:
- **How PP method works**: By projecting and computing convex hulls
- **Why it's effective**: Convex hull gives tight bounds
- **Where bounds come from**: Intersection of hull with f=0 axis
- **Dimension-wise analysis**: Each wall shows one dimension

### Progressive Tightening

As the solver subdivides:
1. Box gets smaller
2. Control points are re-computed for the sub-box
3. Projections change
4. Convex hulls get tighter
5. PP bounds narrow down
6. Solution is found!

## Running the Visualizations

### Step-by-Step Solver Visualization
```bash
uv run python examples/visualize_2d_step_by_step.py
```
Generates 8 PNG files showing each step with projections on walls.

### Projection Demonstration
```bash
uv run python examples/demo_projection_walls.py
```
Generates 2 PNG files with clear views of projections for each equation.

## Key Insights from Visualization

1. **Projection is Geometric**: You can literally see the control points being projected onto the walls

2. **Convex Hull is Visual**: The dashed lines show the convex hull boundary

3. **PP Bounds are Clear**: The thick line at f=0 shows exactly where the bounds come from

4. **Dimension Independence**: Each wall shows one dimension independently

5. **Correctness Verification**: You can visually verify that the PP bounds make sense by looking at where the convex hull crosses f=0

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before
- Only showed surfaces and control points in 3D
- Hard to understand where PP bounds came from
- No visual connection to the projection method

### After
- ✅ Shows projections on background walls
- ✅ Displays convex hulls of projected points
- ✅ Marks PP bounds as thick lines at f=0
- ✅ Clear visual explanation of the PP method
- ✅ Easy to verify correctness

## Educational Value

This visualization is excellent for:
- **Understanding the PP method**: See exactly how it works
- **Debugging**: Verify that projections are correct
- **Teaching**: Explain the method to others
- **Research**: Analyze why PP method is effective

## Technical Details

### Projection Implementation

```python
def draw_projections_on_walls(ax, ctrl_points_3d, color, x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max):
    # Project onto (x, f) plane - draw on back wall at y = y_max
    proj_x = ctrl_points_3d[:, [0, 2]]  # (x, f) coordinates
    
    # Compute convex hull
    hull_x = convex_hull_2d(proj_x)
    
    # Find intersection with f=0
    intersection = intersect_convex_hull_with_x_axis(proj_x)
    
    # Draw on back wall
    ax.plot([x_int_min, x_int_max], [y_max, y_max], [0, 0], ...)
```

### Wall Positions

- **Back wall**: y = y_max (furthest from viewer)
- **Side wall**: x = x_min (left side)
- These positions ensure projections don't obscure the main surface

## Conclusion

The enhanced 3D visualizations now provide a complete picture of how the PP method works:
- ✅ Shows the polynomial surface
- ✅ Shows the zero-crossing curve
- ✅ Shows control points in 3D
- ✅ Shows projections on walls
- ✅ Shows convex hulls
- ✅ Shows PP bounds derivation

This makes the PP method transparent and easy to understand!
