## What You'll See in Each Panel

### 📊 Panel 1: Equation 1 (Circle: x² + y² - 1 = 0)

**Main Elements**:
- 🔵 **Blue surface** - the polynomial surface
- 🔵 **Blue curve** - where surface crosses z=0 (the solution curve)
- ⚫ **Black box** - current search region
- 🟠 **Orange box** - PP bounds for this equation only
- ⭐ **Black dots** - Bernstein control points in 3D

**On Background Walls**:
- 🔵 **Blue dots** - projected control points
- 🔵 **Blue dashed lines** - convex hull of projections
- 🔵 **Blue thick lines at f=0** - PP bounds for each dimension

**Legend**: Current box (black), PP bounds (orange)

## How to Read the Visualizations

### Step 1: Look at Panel 1 (Blue/Orange)
- Find the blue curve on z=0 plane
- See the orange box - these are PP bounds from the circle equation
- Check the projections on walls to see how PP method computed these bounds

### Step 2: Look at Panel 2 (Red/Purple)
- Find the red curve on z=0 plane
- See the purple box - these are PP bounds from the ellipse equation
- Check the projections on walls to see how PP method computed these bounds

### Step 3: Compare Orange vs Purple
- Which box is tighter in x-direction?
- Which box is tighter in y-direction?
- This shows which equation provides better constraints!

### Step 4: Look at Panel 3 (Combined)
- The green box is the **intersection** of orange and purple boxes
- This is where BOTH equations could have roots
- The gold star shows where the actual solution is
- Much cleaner without projections!

## Example: Understanding Step 1

**Panel 1 (Circle)**:
- Orange box: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- Circle doesn't tighten the bounds much initially

**Panel 2 (Ellipse)**:
- Purple box: [0, 1] × [0.1875, 0.625]
- Ellipse tightens y-bounds significantly!

**Panel 3 (Combined)**:
- Green box: [0, 1] × [0.1875, 0.625]
- Takes the tightest bounds from both equations
- Y-bounds come from ellipse (purple)
- X-bounds are still [0, 1] (both equations agree)

**Decision**: Subdivide x-direction (didn't tighten)

---

## Example: Understanding Step 8 (Solution)

**Panel 1 (Circle)**:
- Orange box: very small, tightly around solution
- Circle equation confirms solution is here

**Panel 2 (Ellipse)**:
- Purple box: very small, tightly around solution
- Ellipse equation confirms solution is here

**Panel 3 (Combined)**:
- Green box: very small (intersection of orange & purple)
- Gold star is inside the green box ✓
- Solution found!

## What Changed from Previous Version?

### ✅ Added to Individual Panels (1 & 2)
- Orange/Purple PP bounds boxes on z=0 plane
- Current box (black) on z=0 plane
- Legend showing what each box means

### ✅ Removed from Combined Panel (3)
- Projections on walls (was too cluttered)
- Control points (not needed in combined view)

### ✅ Kept in All Panels
- Surfaces and curves
- Bounding boxes on z=0 plane
- Clear color coding

## Tips for Best Understanding

1. **Start with individual panels**: See how each equation contributes
2. **Compare the colored boxes**: Orange vs Purple vs Green
3. **Check the combined panel**: Verify green = intersection of orange & purple
4. **Watch progression**: See how boxes shrink over multiple steps
5. **Look at walls**: Understand how PP method projects control points

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is the orange box different from the purple box?**
A: Each equation has different constraints. The circle and ellipse have different shapes, so they provide different bounds.

**Q: Why is the green box sometimes smaller than both orange and purple?**
A: The green box is the **intersection** of orange and purple. It takes the tightest bound from each dimension.

**Q: Why no projections in panel 3?**
A: To reduce clutter. Panels 1 & 2 already show projections. Panel 3 focuses on the solution region.

**Q: What if orange and purple boxes don't overlap?**
A: That would mean no solution exists! The solver would prune that box.

**Q: Why different colors for PP bounds?**
A: To distinguish from the curves:
- Orange ≠ Blue (circle)
- Purple ≠ Red (ellipse)
- Green = neutral for combined
