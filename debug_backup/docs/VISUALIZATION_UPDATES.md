# Visualization Updates - Individual PP Bounds and Cleaner Combined View

## Changes Made

### 1. Individual Equation Graphs Now Show Their Own PP Bounds

**Previous behavior**: Individual equation graphs only showed projections on walls, no bounding boxes on z=0 plane.

**New behavior**: Each individual equation graph now shows:
- ✅ Projections on background walls (unchanged)
- ✅ Current box (black rectangle on z=0 plane)
- ✅ **PP bounds for that specific equation** (colored rectangle on z=0 plane)

**Color scheme for PP bounds**:
- **Orange** for Equation 1 (blue curve) - distinct from the blue curve
- **Purple** for Equation 2 (red curve) - distinct from the red curve

### 2. Combined Graph Simplified

**Previous behavior**: The third graph (both equations) showed projections on walls for both equations, which was cluttered.

**New behavior**: The combined graph now shows:
- ✅ Both surfaces (blue and red)
- ✅ Both curves on z=0 plane
- ✅ Current box (black rectangle)
- ✅ Combined PP bounds (green rectangle) - intersection of both equations' bounds
- ✅ Expected solution (gold star)
- ❌ **No projections on walls** - cleaner view!

## Visual Comparison

### Panel 1: Equation 1 (Circle)
```
- Blue surface: x² + y² - 1 = 0
- Blue curve: where surface crosses z=0
- Black box: current search region
- Orange box: PP bounds for this equation only
- Projections on walls: (x,f) and (y,f) with convex hulls
```

### Panel 2: Equation 2 (Ellipse)
```
- Red surface: x²/4 + 4y² - 1 = 0
- Red curve: where surface crosses z=0
- Black box: current search region
- Purple box: PP bounds for this equation only
- Projections on walls: (x,f) and (y,f) with convex hulls
```

### Panel 3: Both Equations Combined
```
- Blue surface + Red surface
- Blue curve + Red curve
- Black box: current search region
- Green box: combined PP bounds (intersection of orange and purple)
- Gold star: expected solution
- NO projections on walls (cleaner!)
```

## Why These Changes?

### Individual PP Bounds Are Informative

Each equation has its own PP bounds, which can be different:
- **Equation 1** might tighten more in x-direction
- **Equation 2** might tighten more in y-direction
- The **combined bounds** are the intersection of both

Showing individual bounds helps understand:
- Which equation is providing the tighter constraint in each dimension
- How each equation contributes to the overall bounds
- Why the combined bounds are what they are

### Example from Step 1

**Equation 1 (Circle)**: PP bounds might be [0, 1] × [0, 1]
**Equation 2 (Ellipse)**: PP bounds might be [0, 1] × [0.1875, 0.625]
**Combined**: [0, 1] × [0.1875, 0.625] (intersection)

The ellipse provides the tighter y-bounds!

### Cleaner Combined View

The third panel was getting cluttered with:
- Two sets of projections (blue and red)
- Two sets of convex hulls
- Overlapping projection points

By removing projections from the combined view:
- ✅ Easier to see the curves and their intersection
- ✅ Clearer view of the bounding boxes
- ✅ Less visual clutter
- ✅ Focus on the solution region

The individual panels still show projections, so you can still see how PP method works!

## Color Coding Summary

| Element | Color | Location |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Equation 1 curve | Blue | All panels |
| Equation 2 curve | Red | All panels |
| Current box | Black | All panels |
| Eq1 PP bounds | **Orange** | Panel 1 only |
| Eq2 PP bounds | **Purple** | Panel 2 only |
| Combined PP bounds | Green | Panel 3 only |
| Expected solution | Gold star | Panel 3 only |
| Projections on walls | Blue/Red | Panels 1 & 2 only |

## Implementation Details

### Computing Individual PP Bounds

In `visualize_box()`:
```python
# Compute PP bounds for each equation individually
pp_result_eq1 = find_root_box_pp_nd([eq1_bern], k=2, tolerance=self.subdivision_tolerance)
pp_result_eq2 = find_root_box_pp_nd([eq2_bern], k=2, tolerance=self.subdivision_tolerance)

# Pass to individual plots
self.plot_surface(ax1, box_range, eq1_bern, 'Equation 1', 'blue', pp_result_eq1)
self.plot_surface(ax2, box_range, eq2_bern, 'Equation 2', 'red', pp_result_eq2)

# Combined plot uses intersection of both (pp_result)
self.plot_both_surfaces(ax3, box_range, eq1_bern, eq2_bern, pp_result)
```

### Drawing PP Bounds with Different Colors

In `plot_surface()`:
```python
# Use orange for blue curve, purple for red curve
pp_box_color = 'orange' if color == 'blue' else 'purple'

# Draw PP bounding box on z=0 plane
ax.plot(pp_corners_x, pp_corners_y, [0]*5, color=pp_box_color, 
       linewidth=3, alpha=0.9, label='PP bounds')
```

### Simplified Combined View

In `plot_both_surfaces()`:
```python
# Removed: projection drawing code
# Kept: surfaces, curves, boxes, solution marker
```

## Benefits

### Educational Value
- **See individual contributions**: Each equation's PP bounds shown separately
- **Understand intersection**: Combined bounds are clearly the intersection
- **Less clutter**: Combined view is easier to read

### Debugging Value
- **Identify weak constraints**: If one equation's bounds are [0,1], it's not helping
- **Verify correctness**: Individual bounds should contain the solution
- **Spot issues**: If individual bounds don't overlap, something is wrong

### Visual Clarity
- **Color distinction**: Orange and purple are clearly different from blue and red curves
- **Focused panels**: Each panel has a clear purpose
- **Progressive detail**: Individual panels show details, combined shows overview

## Example Interpretation

Looking at a visualization:

**Panel 1 (Blue/Orange)**:
- Orange box is [0.85, 0.93] × [0.43, 0.47]
- Circle equation provides these bounds

**Panel 2 (Red/Purple)**:
- Purple box is [0.88, 0.91] × [0.44, 0.46]
- Ellipse equation provides tighter bounds!

**Panel 3 (Green)**:
- Green box is [0.88, 0.91] × [0.44, 0.46]
- This is the intersection (tightest bounds from both)
- Solution must be in this region

## Files Modified

- `examples/visualize_2d_step_by_step.py`
  - Modified `plot_surface()`: Added `pp_result` parameter, draws PP bounds in orange/purple
  - Modified `plot_both_surfaces()`: Removed projection drawing code
  - Modified `visualize_box()`: Computes individual PP bounds for each equation

## Generated Output

Running `uv run python examples/visualize_2d_step_by_step.py` generates 8 PNG files:
- Each shows 3 panels with the new color scheme
- Individual panels show orange/purple PP bounds
- Combined panel shows green PP bounds (no projections)
- All panels show projections on walls for individual equations

## Summary

The visualization now provides:
- ✅ **Individual PP bounds** in distinct colors (orange/purple)
- ✅ **Cleaner combined view** without projection clutter
- ✅ **Better understanding** of how each equation contributes
- ✅ **Easier interpretation** with clear color coding
- ✅ **Maintained detail** in individual panels with projections

This makes it much easier to understand the PP method and how the solver works!
