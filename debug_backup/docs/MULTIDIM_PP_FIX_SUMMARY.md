# Multidimensional PP Projection Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The multidimensional PP (Projected Polyhedron) method was using an **incorrect projection approach** that was too conservative and failed to tighten bounds effectively.

### What Was Wrong

**Old (Incorrect) Method** in `_extract_dimension_range`:
1. Take slices along other dimensions
2. Apply 1D PP method to each slice independently
3. Take the **UNION** of all slice ranges

**Why This Failed**:
- For equation x² + y² - 1 = 0, projecting onto x-dimension:
  - Slice at y=0: coeffs [-1, -1, 0] → zero at x ∈ [0.5, 1]
  - Slice at y=0.5: coeffs [-1, -1, 0] → zero at x ∈ [0.5, 1]
  - Slice at y=1: coeffs [0, 0, 1] → zero at x ∈ [0, 0.5]
  - **Union**: x ∈ [0, 1] ← Too wide! Not useful!
- This gave bounds that never tightened during subdivision
- The 2D circle-ellipse test failed to find the solution

## Solution: Correct Projection Method

Implemented the **correct projection method from the paper**:

### Algorithm

For dimension j of a k-dimensional Bernstein polynomial:

1. **Project all control points** onto the 2D plane (t_j, f):
   - Each control point has coordinates (i₁/n₁, i₂/n₂, ..., iₖ/nₖ, f_{i₁,i₂,...,iₖ})
   - Project to (iⱼ/nⱼ, f_{i₁,i₂,...,iₖ})

2. **Compute 2D convex hull** of these projected points

3. **Intersect with axis** f=0 to find where the hull crosses zero

4. **Return bounds** on parameter tⱼ

### Code Changes

**File**: `src/intersection/convex_hull.py`
**Function**: `_extract_dimension_range` (lines 319-386)

```python
def _extract_dimension_range(coeffs: np.ndarray,
                             dim: int,
                             k: int,
                             tolerance: float = 1e-10) -> Optional[Tuple[float, float]]:
    """
    Extract the range for a specific dimension from k-D Bernstein coefficients.
    
    This implements the correct projection method from the paper:
    For dimension j, we project all control points onto the 2D plane (t_j, f).
    """
    if k == 1:
        return find_root_box_pp_1d(coeffs, tolerance)

    # Quick check: if all coefficients have same sign, no root
    overall_min = np.min(coeffs)
    overall_max = np.max(coeffs)
    
    if overall_min > tolerance or overall_max < -tolerance:
        return None

    # Project all control points onto (t_dim, f) plane
    shape = coeffs.shape
    indices = np.ndindex(*shape)
    
    projected_points = []
    for multi_idx in indices:
        f_value = coeffs[multi_idx]
        i_dim = multi_idx[dim]
        n_dim = shape[dim]
        
        if n_dim == 1:
            t_dim = 0.5
        else:
            t_dim = i_dim / (n_dim - 1)
        
        projected_points.append([t_dim, f_value])
    
    projected_points = np.array(projected_points)
    
    # Compute 2D convex hull and intersect with t-axis (f=0)
    return intersect_convex_hull_with_x_axis(projected_points, tolerance)
```

## Results

### Test Case: 2D Circle-Ellipse Intersection

**Equations**:
- Circle: x² + y² - 1 = 0
- Ellipse: x²/4 + 4y² - 1 = 0
- Domain: [0, 1]²

**Expected Solution**: (0.894427, 0.447214)

### Before Fix
- ❌ Found 0 solutions
- Only 6 boxes processed before stopping
- PP bounds never tightened in x-dimension
- Solution was incorrectly pruned

### After Fix
- ✅ Found 1 solution: (0.894425, 0.447221)
- Error: ~0.00001 (excellent!)
- Only 8 boxes processed (very efficient!)
- Residuals: 2.25e-6 and 2.39e-5 (very small)

### Convergence Behavior

**Step 1**: Initial box [0,1]²
- PP bounds: [0,1] × [0.1875, 0.625]
- Action: Subdivide x-dimension

**Step 2**: Left half [0, 0.5] × [0.1875, 0.625]
- Action: PRUNED (no solution here) ✓

**Step 3**: Right half [0.5, 1.0] × [0.1875, 0.625]
- PP bounds: [0.479, 0.965] × [0.429, 0.714]
- Action: TIGHTEN (both dimensions reduced ≥50%)

**Steps 4-7**: Continued tightening
- Box progressively shrinks around solution
- PP method works in **both dimensions** now!

**Step 8**: Final box
- Size: 0.0012 × 0.0006
- Action: SOLUTION found ✓

- Clear view of curves and bounding boxes on z=0 plane
- Shows progressive tightening:
  1. `topdown_step1_initial.png` - Initial box [0,1]²
  2. `topdown_step2_right_half.png` - After first subdivision
  3. `topdown_step3_tightened.png` - After first tightening
  4. `topdown_step4_near_solution.png` - Near solution (highly tightened)

## Key Insights

1. **Projection matters**: The way we project multidimensional control points to 1D is critical for the PP method's effectiveness.

2. **Correct geometry**: The new method correctly represents the geometry of the polynomial surface by projecting all control points, not just slices.

3. **Tightening in all dimensions**: With the correct projection, PP bounds tighten in **all dimensions** during subdivision, not just some.

4. **Efficiency**: The solver converges rapidly with only 8 boxes processed for a 2D system.

5. **Paper implementation**: The fix implements the projection method exactly as described in the academic paper on PP methods for Bernstein polynomials.
