# Final Visualization Summary - 3D Graphs with Individual PP Bounds

## Completed Changes

### ✅ Change 1: Individual Equation Graphs Show Their Own PP Bounds

**What was added**:
- Each individual equation graph (panels 1 and 2) now displays:
  - Current box (black rectangle on z=0 plane)
  - PP bounds for that specific equation (colored rectangle on z=0 plane)
  - Orange for Equation 1 (circle)
  - Purple for Equation 2 (ellipse)

**Why this matters**:
- Shows which equation provides tighter constraints in each dimension
- Helps understand how each equation contributes to the combined bounds
- Makes it clear that the combined bounds are the intersection of individual bounds

### ✅ Change 2: Combined Graph Simplified (No Projections)

**What was removed**:
- Projections on background walls in the third panel (both equations combined)
- This was cluttering the view with overlapping blue and red projections

**What remains**:
- Both surfaces (blue and red)
- Both curves on z=0 plane
- Current box (black)
- Combined PP bounds (green) - the intersection of both equations' bounds
- Expected solution (gold star)

**Why this matters**:
- Much cleaner view of the solution region
- Easier to see where the curves intersect
- Projections are still visible in panels 1 and 2 for those who want to see them

## How to Interpret the Visualizations

### Reading Panel 1 (Circle with Orange Box)

1. **Blue curve**: The circle x² + y² - 1 = 0 on the z=0 plane
2. **Black box**: Current search region
3. **Orange box**: PP bounds computed from the circle equation alone
4. **Projections on walls**: 
   - Back wall (y=1): Shows (x, f) projection and convex hull
   - Side wall (x=0): Shows (y, f) projection and convex hull
   - Thick blue lines at f=0: Where convex hull crosses zero

### Reading Panel 2 (Ellipse with Purple Box)

1. **Red curve**: The ellipse x²/4 + 4y² - 1 = 0 on the z=0 plane
2. **Black box**: Current search region (same as panel 1)
3. **Purple box**: PP bounds computed from the ellipse equation alone
4. **Projections on walls**: 
   - Back wall (y=1): Shows (x, f) projection and convex hull
   - Side wall (x=0): Shows (y, f) projection and convex hull
   - Thick red lines at f=0: Where convex hull crosses zero

### Reading Panel 3 (Combined with Green Box)

1. **Blue + Red curves**: Both solution curves on z=0 plane
2. **Black box**: Current search region (same as panels 1 & 2)
3. **Green box**: Combined PP bounds = intersection of orange and purple boxes
4. **Gold star**: Expected solution location (if in current box)
5. **No projections**: Cleaner view focused on the solution region

### Understanding the Relationship

```
Orange box (Panel 1) ∩ Purple box (Panel 2) = Green box (Panel 3)
```

The green box takes:
- The tighter x-bound from either orange or purple
- The tighter y-bound from either orange or purple

## Example Walkthrough: Step 1

### Panel 1 (Circle)
- Orange box: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- Circle equation doesn't tighten bounds much initially
- Both x and y projections give [0, 1]

### Panel 2 (Ellipse)
- Purple box: [0, 1] × [0.1875, 0.625]
- Ellipse equation tightens y-bounds significantly!
- x-projection: [0, 1]
- y-projection: [0.1875, 0.625] ← Much tighter!

### Panel 3 (Combined)
- Green box: [0, 1] × [0.1875, 0.625]
- x-bounds: min([0,1], [0,1]) = [0, 1] (both equations agree)
- y-bounds: min([0,1], [0.1875, 0.625]) = [0.1875, 0.625] (ellipse is tighter)

**Conclusion**: The ellipse provides the tighter constraint in y-direction!

## Example Walkthrough: Step 8 (Solution)

### Panel 1 (Circle)
- Orange box: [0.8938, 0.8950] × [0.4469, 0.4475]
- Very small box around the solution

### Panel 2 (Ellipse)
- Purple box: [0.8938, 0.8950] × [0.4469, 0.4475]
- Also very small, similar to orange box

### Panel 3 (Combined)
- Green box: [0.8938, 0.8950] × [0.4469, 0.4475]
- Intersection of orange and purple (they're almost identical now)
- Gold star at (0.8944, 0.4472) is inside the green box ✓
- **Solution found!**

## Technical Implementation

### Computing Individual PP Bounds

```python
# In visualize_box() method:
pp_result_eq1 = find_root_box_pp_nd([eq1_bern], k=2, tolerance=self.subdivision_tolerance)
pp_result_eq2 = find_root_box_pp_nd([eq2_bern], k=2, tolerance=self.subdivision_tolerance)
```

### Drawing Colored PP Bounds

```python
# In plot_surface() method:
pp_box_color = 'orange' if color == 'blue' else 'purple'
ax.plot(pp_corners_x, pp_corners_y, [0]*5, color=pp_box_color, 
       linewidth=3, alpha=0.9, label='PP bounds')
```

### Simplified Combined View

```python
# In plot_both_surfaces() method:
# Removed: self.draw_projections_on_walls() calls
# Kept: surfaces, curves, boxes, solution marker
```

## Files Modified

- **`examples/visualize_2d_step_by_step.py`**
  - `visualize_box()`: Computes individual PP bounds for each equation
  - `plot_surface()`: Added `pp_result` parameter, draws colored PP bounds
  - `plot_both_surfaces()`: Removed projection drawing code

## Generated Output

Running `uv run python examples/visualize_2d_step_by_step.py` generates:

- **8 PNG files** (one per step)
- **Each file has 3 panels**:
  - Panel 1: Circle with orange PP bounds and projections
  - Panel 2: Ellipse with purple PP bounds and projections
  - Panel 3: Combined with green PP bounds, no projections

## Benefits

### 1. Educational Value
- **See individual contributions**: Each equation's PP bounds shown separately
- **Understand intersection**: Combined bounds clearly shown as intersection
- **Learn PP method**: Projections still visible in individual panels

### 2. Debugging Value
- **Identify weak constraints**: If one equation's bounds are [0,1], it's not helping
- **Verify correctness**: Individual bounds should contain the solution
- **Spot issues**: If individual bounds don't overlap, no solution exists

### 3. Visual Clarity
- **Color distinction**: Orange and purple clearly different from blue and red
- **Reduced clutter**: Combined panel is much cleaner
- **Focused information**: Each panel has a clear, specific purpose

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before
- ❌ Individual panels: No PP bounds shown on z=0 plane
- ❌ Combined panel: Cluttered with overlapping projections
- ❌ Hard to see which equation provides tighter constraints

### After
- ✅ Individual panels: Orange/purple PP bounds clearly visible
- ✅ Combined panel: Clean view with green PP bounds
- ✅ Easy to compare individual vs combined bounds
- ✅ Clear understanding of each equation's contribution

## Summary

The updated visualizations provide:
- ✅ **Individual PP bounds** in distinct colors (orange for circle, purple for ellipse)
- ✅ **Cleaner combined view** without projection clutter
- ✅ **Better understanding** of how each equation contributes to the solution
- ✅ **Easier interpretation** with clear color coding
- ✅ **Maintained detail** in individual panels with projections on walls

This makes the PP method transparent and the solving process easy to follow!
