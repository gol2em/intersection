# Fixed PP Method Workflow Visualization

## Summary

Generated **14 PNG files** showing the **CORRECTED** PP method workflow with proper CRIT logic.

## Key Improvements

### Before Fix
- **Boxes processed**: 64,400+
- **Behavior**: Always subdivided, even when PP reduced significantly
- **Result**: Exponential explosion, missing roots

### After Fix
- **Boxes processed**: 14
- **Behavior**: Tightens when PP helps (â‰¥20% reduction), subdivides when PP doesn't help
- **Result**: Efficient convergence, all roots found

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Box [0, 1] â†’ TIGHTEN
**File**: `debug_step_0001_depth0_tighten.png`

```
PP bounds: [0.121, 0.879]
PP width: 0.758 (CRIT: 0.8)
Reduction: 24.24%
Decision: 0.758 â‰¤ 0.8 â†’ TIGHTEN (PP reduction â‰¥ 20%)
Action: Extract sub-box [0.121, 0.879] and apply PP again
```

âœ“ **CORRECT**: PP reduced by 24%, so we tighten instead of subdividing!

---

### Step 2: Tightened Box [0.121, 0.879] â†’ SUBDIVIDE
**File**: `debug_step_0002_depth0_subdivide.png`

```
PP bounds: [0.181, 0.819]
PP width: 0.843 (CRIT: 0.8)
Reduction: 15.71%
Decision: 0.843 > 0.8 â†’ SUBDIVIDE (PP reduction < 20%)
Action: Subdivide at midpoint
```

âœ“ **CORRECT**: PP only reduced by 15.7%, so we subdivide to isolate roots better!

---

### Step 3-7: Left Branch â†’ Find Root at 0.2

**Step 3** (`debug_step_0003_depth1_subdivide.png`): Left half [0.121, 0.500]
- PP width: 0.843 > 0.8 â†’ SUBDIVIDE

**Step 4** (`debug_step_0004_depth2_tighten.png`): [0.121, 0.340]
- PP width: 0.391 â‰¤ 0.8 â†’ **TIGHTEN** (60.86% reduction!)

**Step 5** (`debug_step_0005_depth2_tighten.png`): [0.181, 0.267]
- PP width: 0.109 â‰¤ 0.8 â†’ **TIGHTEN** (89.08% reduction!)

**Step 6** (`debug_step_0006_depth2_tighten.png`): [0.198, 0.208]
- PP width: 0.008 â‰¤ 0.8 â†’ **TIGHTEN** (99.18% reduction!)

**Step 7** (`debug_step_0007_depth2_solution.png`): [0.200, 0.200]
- Width < tolerance â†’ **SOLUTION at t = 0.200** âœ“

**Key Observation**: 4 consecutive TIGHTEN operations converged rapidly to the root!

---

### Step 8: Middle Region â†’ Find Root at 0.5

**File**: `debug_step_0008_depth2_solution.png`

```
Box: [0.340, 0.500]
PP bounds: [1.000, 1.000] â†’ Mapped to [0.500, 0.500]
PP width: 0.000
Decision: SOLUTION at t = 0.500 âœ“
```

The PP method perfectly isolated this root!

---

### Step 9-14: Right Branch â†’ Find Root at 0.8

**Step 9** (`debug_step_0009_depth1_subdivide.png`): Right half [0.500, 0.879]
- PP width: 0.843 > 0.8 â†’ SUBDIVIDE

**Step 10** (`debug_step_0010_depth2_solution.png`): [0.500, 0.660]
- PP perfectly isolates â†’ **SOLUTION at t = 0.500** (duplicate)

**Step 11** (`debug_step_0011_depth2_tighten.png`): [0.660, 0.879]
- PP width: 0.391 â‰¤ 0.8 â†’ **TIGHTEN** (60.86% reduction!)

**Step 12** (`debug_step_0012_depth2_tighten.png`): [0.733, 0.819]
- PP width: 0.109 â‰¤ 0.8 â†’ **TIGHTEN** (89.08% reduction!)

**Step 13** (`debug_step_0013_depth2_tighten.png`): [0.792, 0.802]
- PP width: 0.008 â‰¤ 0.8 â†’ **TIGHTEN** (99.18% reduction!)

**Step 14** (`debug_step_0014_depth2_solution.png`): [0.800, 0.800]
- Width < tolerance â†’ **SOLUTION at t = 0.800** âœ“

## Workflow Pattern

The visualization clearly shows the **two-phase approach**:

### Phase 1: TIGHTEN (when PP helps)
```
Box â†’ PP reduces â‰¥20% â†’ Extract tighter box â†’ Apply PP again â†’ Repeat
```

**Example**: Steps 4-7 for root at 0.2
- 60.86% â†’ 89.08% â†’ 99.18% â†’ SOLUTION
- **4 tightening steps** converged rapidly

### Phase 2: SUBDIVIDE (when PP doesn't help)
```
Box â†’ PP reduces <20% â†’ Subdivide â†’ Process both halves
```

**Example**: Steps 2, 3, 9
- PP only reduced 15.71%, so subdivide to isolate roots

| Subdivisions | 3 |
| Tighten operations | 7 |
| Solutions found | 4 (3 unique) |

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Fix (Buggy)
```
Step 1: [0, 1] â†’ PP: [0.121, 0.879] (24% reduction)
  âœ— WRONG: Forced subdivision anyway
  â†’ Created 2 children
  
Step 2: [0, 0.5] â†’ PP: [0.121, 0.5] (24% reduction)
  âœ— WRONG: Forced subdivision anyway
  â†’ Created 2 more children
  
... (continues subdividing)
  
Result: 64,400+ boxes, exponential explosion
```

### After Fix (Correct)
```
Step 1: [0, 1] â†’ PP: [0.121, 0.879] (24% reduction)
  âœ“ CORRECT: Tighten to [0.121, 0.879]
  
Step 2: [0.121, 0.879] â†’ PP: [0.181, 0.819] (15.7% reduction)
  âœ“ CORRECT: Subdivide (PP didn't help much)
  â†’ Created 2 children
  
Step 3-7: Left child â†’ Tighten 4 times â†’ Root at 0.2
Step 8: Middle â†’ Root at 0.5
Step 9-14: Right child â†’ Tighten 4 times â†’ Root at 0.8

Result: 14 boxes, efficient convergence
```

## Key Insights

### 1. TIGHTEN is the Key to Efficiency
The visualization shows that **most of the work is done by tightening**, not subdividing:
- 7 tighten operations
- 3 subdivisions
- Ratio: 2.3 tightens per subdivision

### 2. Rapid Convergence
When PP helps, convergence is **exponential**:
- 60% â†’ 89% â†’ 99% â†’ SOLUTION
- Each tightening step dramatically reduces the box

### 3. Subdivision Only When Needed
Subdivision happens only when:
- PP reduction < 20% (width > 0.8)
- Multiple roots in the box
- Need to isolate roots better

### 4. Symmetry
The left and right branches show **perfect symmetry**:
- Both follow: SUBDIVIDE â†’ TIGHTEN Ã— 4 â†’ SOLUTION
- Same reduction percentages: 60.86% â†’ 89.08% â†’ 99.18%

---

## Duplicate Solution

The visualization found 4 solutions with one duplicate at t=0.5:
- Step 8: Found 0.5 from left branch
- Step 10: Found 0.5 from right branch

This is expected behavior - the deduplication happens in the main solver, not in the visualizer.

---

## Conclusion

âœ… **The fixed PP method works correctly!**

The visualization clearly shows:
1. **TIGHTEN when PP helps** (â‰¥20% reduction)
2. **SUBDIVIDE when PP doesn't help** (<20% reduction)
3. **Rapid convergence** through iterative tightening
4. **Minimal subdivisions** (only 3 for 3 roots)

**The CRIT logic is now working as designed!** ðŸŽ‰
