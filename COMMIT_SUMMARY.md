# Commit Summary - Enhanced 3D Visualizations

## Commit Information

**Commit Hash**: `a457818`  
**Branch**: `master`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Pushed to origin/master  
**Date**: 2025-10-27

## Changes Made

### üé® Enhanced 3D Visualizations

Modified `examples/visualize_2d_step_by_step.py` to show individual PP bounds for each equation:

#### Panel 1 (Circle Equation)
- Shows blue surface and curve
- **NEW**: Orange PP bounds box on z=0 plane
- Projections on background walls (unchanged)
- Current box (black) on z=0 plane

#### Panel 2 (Ellipse Equation)
- Shows red surface and curve
- **NEW**: Purple PP bounds box on z=0 plane
- Projections on background walls (unchanged)
- Current box (black) on z=0 plane

#### Panel 3 (Combined View)
- Shows both surfaces and curves
- **REMOVED**: Projections on walls (cleaner view)
- **KEPT**: Green combined PP bounds box
- Current box (black) and expected solution (gold star)

### üéØ Key Improvements

1. **Individual PP Bounds Visualization**
   - Each equation now shows its own PP bounds
   - Orange for circle, purple for ellipse
   - Makes it clear which equation provides tighter constraints

2. **Cleaner Combined View**
   - Removed overlapping projections from third panel
   - Easier to see the solution region
   - Less visual clutter

3. **Better Color Coding**
   - Orange ‚â† Blue (circle curve)
   - Purple ‚â† Red (ellipse curve)
   - Green = neutral for combined bounds

### üìÅ Files Modified

**Main Changes**:
- `examples/visualize_2d_step_by_step.py`
  - `visualize_box()`: Computes individual PP bounds for each equation
  - `plot_surface()`: Added `pp_result` parameter, draws colored PP bounds
  - `plot_both_surfaces()`: Removed projection drawing code

**New Files Added** (58 total):
- Core implementation files (box.py, convex_hull.py, de_casteljau.py, etc.)
- Example and test files
- Documentation files (essential ones only)

### üßπ Cleanup Performed

**Backed up to `debug_backup/`**:
- All debug PNG images (40+ files)
- Debug documentation (13 MD files)
- Old visualization outputs

**Kept in repository**:
- Essential documentation (README_STANDALONE_SOLVER.md, TOLERANCE_CLASSIFICATION.md, etc.)
- Core implementation files
- Example and test files
- docs/ directory with key documentation

**Not committed**:
- `.idea/` files (IDE settings)
- `debug_backup/` directory (local debug files)

## Testing

‚úÖ **Tested**: `uv run python examples/visualize_2d_step_by_step.py`
- Generated 8 PNG files successfully
- Found solution at (0.894425, 0.447221)
- Error: ~0.00001 (excellent!)
- Only 8 boxes processed (very efficient!)

## Commit Message

```
Enhanced 3D visualizations with individual PP bounds

- Modified visualize_2d_step_by_step.py to show PP bounds for each equation separately
- Panel 1 (circle): Shows orange PP bounds box on z=0 plane
- Panel 2 (ellipse): Shows purple PP bounds box on z=0 plane  
- Panel 3 (combined): Removed projections for cleaner view, shows green combined PP bounds
- Each individual panel computes and displays its own PP bounds
- Color coding: orange for circle, purple for ellipse, green for combined
- Makes it clear which equation provides tighter constraints in each dimension
```
