## Quick Start

### Running the Usage Examples

```bash
# Run all usage examples
uv run python examples/usage_example.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- How to solve 1D polynomials
- How to solve multi-dimensional systems
- How to use different methods (PP vs LP)
- How to compare method performance

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
uv run python examples/benchmark_examples.py
```

This will:
- Test both PP and LP methods
- Generate performance statistics
- Save results to `benchmark_results.txt`

## Method Comparison

### PP (Projected Polyhedron) Method
- **Best for**: 1D problems, simple systems
- **Advantages**: Fast per-box, reliable
- **Disadvantages**: May process more boxes in multi-dimensional cases

### LP (Linear Programming) Method
- **Best for**: Multi-dimensional systems (k ≥ 2)
- **Advantages**: Tighter bounds, fewer boxes for 2D+ systems
- **Disadvantages**: Slower per-box due to LP overhead, may have numerical issues for high-degree 1D polynomials
